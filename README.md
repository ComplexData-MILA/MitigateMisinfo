# MitigateMisinfo

We recommend https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/api_request_parallel_processor.py for running OpenAI experiments.

Most of the output files are paired. "rawoutput" version is output from a script similar to above, while the version without that affix is slightly more processed. We recommend the latter if you just want to work with the main output, but include the former in case it provides any extra useful information.
