LIAR-New dataset: available in LIAR-New directory

Running experiments: we recommend https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/api_request_parallel_processor.py to accelerate OpenAI API requests. Prompts are available in the paper.

Most of the output files are paired. "rawoutput" version is output from a script similar to above, while the version without that affix is slightly more processed. We recommend the latter if you just want to work with the main output, but include the former in case it provides any extra useful information.
